# Project Rules

## Chrome Extension Development
1. **Version Bumping**: Every time any file in the `extension/` directory is modified (HTML, JS, CSS, Images), the `version` field in `extension/manifest.json` MUST be incremented (e.g., 1.5 -> 1.6).
2. **Interface names must start with the letter “I”**
3. **Stick to the KISS principle**
4. **Write short functions that do only one thing**
5. **Split React components into small, reusable sub-components**
